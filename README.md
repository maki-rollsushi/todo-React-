# React ToDo App

A simple, lightweight ToDo application built with React. This app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with persistent local storage support.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ Add new tasks
* ‚úÖ Mark tasks as complete
* ‚úÖ Delete tasks
* ‚úÖ View tasks by status: "Open" or "Completed"
* ‚úÖ Persistent data using `localStorage`

## üí† Tech Stack

* **React** (Functional components + Hooks)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **LocalStorage** for client-side persistence

## üìÅ Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.js

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TodoInput.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TodoList.js

```

## üíø Data Persistence

The app uses the browser's `localStorage` to store tasks. This means your tasks will persist even after a page refresh. However, **clearing browser data or switching devices will remove your tasks**.

```js
// Saving todos
localStorage.setItem('todo-app', JSON.stringify({ todos }));

// Loading todos on startup
const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todo-app'));
setTodos(saved.todos);
```

## üß† How It Works

* `App.js` handles all core state logic for tasks.
* `addTodo`, `completeTodo`, and `deleteTodo` functions manage task updates and persist them to `localStorage`.
* The UI is broken into separate components (`Header`, `Tabs`, `TodoList`, and `TodoInput`) for maintainability.
* The app supports filtering between "Open" and "Completed" tasks using the `Tabs` component.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-app.git
cd react-todo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

* Support for editing existing todos
* Dark mode
* User authentication to sync todos across devices
* Backend integration for real persistence
